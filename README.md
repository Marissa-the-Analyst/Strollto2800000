# Stroll to 2800000
I took 2,600,00 steps in 2024, I've walked significantly less in the first quarter of this year in comparison to last. Can I hit my ambitious goal of 2,800,000 by EOY and overcome a significant step deficit?

### Challenge Concluded! ###
This challenge is over! I wrote a LinkedIn article [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stroll-2800000-2025-conclusion-marissa-nash-1tfse/?trackingId=4ouQrPGyQ2eU1fe2%2FymCBA%3D%3D) detailing the more personal side of what I learned during it. It's a shame to be so close to hitting my goal, but I learned a lot about myself and updating data doing it! Give it a read and thanks for following :)!

### Programs Used ###
  - Excel for data
  - Tableau

### Scope of Work ###
**Deliverables** <br>
  - A dataset with 12 entries recording:
    -EntryId 
    -Steps 
    -Month 
    -Goal 
    -Goal Difference 
    -Rolling total 
  - An easily updatable dashboard detailing step progress and several useful KPIs.  

### Goals for the Data Viz ###
I wanted to get more familiar with creating Tableau dashboards. I’m working through a more complex floating style dashboard, and it made me want to return to fundamentals. The goal of this dashboard is to create a simple tiled dashboard that has clear KPIs, can be updated easily, and tells a clear data story. <br>

Of course, on a personal note, another goal is to encourage me to get out of the house more and be less sedentary. While my current job has me on my feet, for most of the day, on my off days I feel compelled to either relax by playing computer games, work on school projects, or personal development projects like this! Such behavior results in me being sedentary on my computer for at least 70% of my off days. Having a step goal encourages me to get out, get moving, and ideally not be looking at screens so much!  

### Key Viz Metrics ###
  - Easily Updatable 
  - Performance and comparison to prior month 
  - Progress percentage 
  - Gap needed to meet goals 
  - Overall deficits/surpluses

### KPI Designs ###
This was my first time building out KPIs in a dashboard and formatting text and building all the calculated fields was a challenge! I tried to frame this step project in a way that still would have value to stakeholders. In my current line of work in a warehouse, some common KPIs include moving cartons, reducing downtime, and processing seasonal cube within a timely manner. For a step-tracking project, I thought data such as current month performance, its comparison to last month, overall progress, remaining steps needed per month, and whether I am behind schedule or ahead of schedule could be relevant to the end users. I kept the titles of the KPIs and made the key number a larger font so that the reader can quickly get the information needed from the KPI.  

### Viz Design ###
Since I wanted to keep the graphics simple, I decided to stick with one graph. I was inspired by Kickstarter goals or classic simple goals drawn out and filled in as they got closer to the goal. Ie: Progress! It was important to me to clearly define the goal line and the current steps. Breaking it down into months added an enjoyable layer of complexity where the user can see in what months larger strides were made. This what my first time using reference lines and I found them very handy for this visualization. I allowed myself a bit freedom in color palette due to how simple the dashboard is, though I might change it to a gradient later to quickly visualize more productive months.
